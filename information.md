To achieve this behavior, you can use a different approach by using the browser's native print functionality. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a function to trigger the print:**

   ```jsx
   const printDocument = () => {
     window.print();
   };
   ```

2. **Create a button in your component and call the `printDocument` function when it's clicked:**

   ```jsx
   <button onClick={printDocument}>Print</button>
   ```

In this approach, when the user clicks the "Print" button, it will trigger the browser's native print dialog, allowing the user to select the printer and print the document directly. Note that the user still has control over the print process and can cancel or adjust print settings through the browser's print dialog.

Please keep in mind that bypassing the print dialog entirely without user interaction is generally discouraged due to security and user experience considerations. Users typically expect to have control over what gets printed and which printer is used, so it's a good practice to respect their preferences and allow them to confirm the print action through the print dialog.

To print something with React and a thermal printer, you can use libraries like `esc-pos-encoder` for encoding text into ESC/POS commands and `usb` or `bluetooth-serial-port` to communicate with the thermal printer over USB or Bluetooth connections.

Here's an example of how you can print text to a thermal printer using these libraries in a React application:

1. **Install the necessary packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install esc-pos-encoder usb bluetooth-serial-port
   ```

2. **Create a `Printer` component:**

   ```jsx
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import escpos from 'esc-pos-encoder';
   import usb from 'usb';
   import bluetoothSerialPort from 'bluetooth-serial-port';

   const Printer = () => {
     const [printerType, setPrinterType] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       // Detect printer type based on the connected devices
       const detectPrinter = () => {
         const devices = usb.getDeviceList();
         const bluetoothDevices = bluetoothSerialPort.list();
         if (devices.length > 0) {
           setPrinterType('usb');
         } else if (bluetoothDevices.length > 0) {
           setPrinterType('bluetooth');
         } else {
           console.log('No compatible printers found.');
         }
       };

       detectPrinter();
     }, []);

     const printToUSBPrinter = () => {
       const device = new escpos.USB();
       const printer = new escpos.Printer(device);

       device.open(() => {
         printer
           .text('Hello, Thermal Printer!')
           .lineFeed(2)
           .cut()
           .close();
       });
     };

     const printToBluetoothPrinter = () => {
       const address = '00:00:00:00:00:00'; // Replace with your printer's Bluetooth address
       const channel = 1; // Bluetooth SPP port number

       const printer = new escpos.Printer(new escpos.Bluetooth(address, channel));

       printer
         .text('Hello, Thermal Printer!')
         .lineFeed(2)
         .cut()
         .flush();
     };

     return (
       <div>
         {printerType === 'usb' && <button onClick={printToUSBPrinter}>Print to USB Printer</button>}
         {printerType === 'bluetooth' && (
           <button onClick={printToBluetoothPrinter}>Print to Bluetooth Printer</button>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Printer;
   ```

   In this example, the component detects the connected printers (either USB or Bluetooth) and provides corresponding buttons to print the text. Replace `'00:00:00:00:00:00'` in the `printToBluetoothPrinter` function with your actual Bluetooth printer's address.

3. **Include the `Printer` component in your main App component or any other component where you want to use the printing functionality.**

   Now, when you click the respective button, it will send the text to the connected thermal printer either via USB or Bluetooth, depending on the detected printer type.

Please note that the actual usage might vary based on the specific thermal printer model and its compatibility with the libraries. Be sure to refer to the documentation of the thermal printer and the libraries you are using for more detailed information on setting up the connection and sending print commands.
