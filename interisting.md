If you want to bypass the browser's print dialog and print directly to a specified printer without any user interaction, you would need to use a server-side solution, as web browsers typically do not allow direct access to printers for security reasons. In this case, you would need to implement a server-side script (e.g., in Node.js or another server-side technology) to send the print job to the printer.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might achieve this:

1. Set up a server: Create a server that can handle HTTP requests. You can use a web framework like Express.js if you're using Node.js.

2. Create an API endpoint: Define an API endpoint that accepts print requests. This endpoint should include information about what needs to be printed, such as the content, the printer to use, and any other relevant settings.

3. Use a server-side library: On the server, you can use a server-side library or tool to send the print job to the printer. The choice of library or tool will depend on your server's technology and the printer you are working with. For example, in Node.js, you might use the `printer` or `node-printer` package to interact with the printer.

4. Trigger the print request: From your React application, you can make an HTTP POST request to the server's print endpoint when you want to print something. You can use a library like `axios` to make the request.

Here's a simplified example of what your server-side code (Node.js with Express) might look like:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const printer = require('printer'); // Use an appropriate library for your printer

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/print', (req, res) => {
  const { content, printerName, otherOptions } = req.body;

  // Send the print job to the specified printer
  printer.printDirect({ data: content, printer: printerName, type: 'RAW', success: jobID => {
    console.log(`Print job sent successfully with job ID: ${jobID}`);
    res.status(200).send('Print job sent successfully.');
  }, error: err => {
    console.error('Error while printing:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Error while printing.');
  }});
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In your React application, you can send a print request to the server's `/print` endpoint with the content you want to print, the desired printer name, and any other print options.

Please note that implementing direct server-side printing is more complex than client-side printing and may require additional setup, especially if you want to support different types of printers. The exact implementation will depend on your server-side technology and the specific requirements of your application.
